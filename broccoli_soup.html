    <h4>Finished Broccoli Soup</h4>
    <p>This recipe is thick and flavorful. It is simple, delicious, and quick to make, enjoy (I know you will).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>8 cups broccoli florets</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in medium sized stock pot, and saute onion and celery until tender. Add broccoli
            and broth, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the
            blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the
            soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot.
            Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>In small saucepan, over medium-heat melt 3 tablespoons butter, stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick
            and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.</li>
    </ol>
